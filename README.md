# Geppetto Sibernetic wrapper
This Geppetto module contains a model interpreter for [Sibernetic](http://sibernetic.org/), a simulator for fluid mechanics using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. 
Through this module Geppetto has the ability to read a Sibernetic configuration build an internal object representation for it and visualize it.
This bundle also hosts an external simulator capable of using Sibernetic to run a simulation. Sibernetic has to be installed independently and has to be available on the server for this to work.

For information about how this fits into [Geppetto](http://www.geppetto.org/) refer to the umbrella project [org.geppetto](https://github.com/openworm/org.geppetto) on GitHub.
